# WEEK 1:

1. Bad version : It is a simple binary search problem.
2. Stones and Jewels: We can solve this by counting the occurrence of characters. (Can use hash tables.)
3. Ransome Notes: This is also similar to last problem and requires the counts of each element in the 	
	strings.
4. Number Complement: This includes bitmasking. We assume a bitmask as 1 and then find AND(&&) with each digit in the 		number. Simulataneously we store result in the result variable.
5. First Unique Character: Store the occurrence of each character in a array(26) and find the first char with count 1.
6. Majority Element: Simple hash map solution. Just need to count the occurrence of each number.
7. Cousins in Binary Tree: Level order traversal in which we need to keep the count of elements in each layer and the parents of given x and y.
